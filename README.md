## Bend is a modern text editor

Bend is an editor that aims to be elegant, clean and a pleasure to work in. It exploits XAML / WPF / Direct 2D to render beautiful hardware accelerated text, with features tuned to balance performance and style. Download the latest version and take it for a spin. Bend is work in progress, expect bugs and occasional surprise features.

## Lightning fast

Using a technique called virtualized display, Bend holds in memory just the lines you see on screen. When opening large files processing the lines not on screen is offloaded to a separate thread. Bend is faster than notepad at opening large files.

## Tabs

Like every good editor Bend has tabs but it doesn't stop there, Bend supports tear away tabs along with drag & drop tab rearrangement. Speaking of drag & drop, hold down ALT while starting a tab drag to drop the file to another application like Windows Explorer or Visual Studio.

## Settings 

Knobs and buttons you can tweak to your taste. Choose a Theme, color Bend dark or Turn off line numbering. Everything you need is neatly hidden away behind the Bend logo.

## Search

Find on page is easy to reach on the top right. Find on page is fluid, asynchronous and never makes you wait for Bend to catch up.

Ctrl + H brings up the Find & Replace dialog where you can do advanced Regex Search and Replacement. If you already know where to go - Ctrl + G brings up the goto line number dialog.

## Misc

Lots of careful touches that you will appreciate. Find dims the entire page to make the search results stand out. Instant Zoom (ctrl+mouse wheel). Right click integration with Windows Explorer. File change monitoring, notifies if the file you are editing changes underneath you. Syntax highlighting for over 30+ languages, plus heuristics that detect the language as you type. Infinite Clipboard (Ctrl + Shift + Insert), never loose anything you copied within Bend.

Bend is built on Microsoft ClickOnce technology and auto updates every 7 days, this makes sure you always have the latest and greatest.
