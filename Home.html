<div>Bend is an editor that aims to be elegant, clean and a pleasure to work in. It exploits XAML / WPF / Direct 2D to render beautiful hardware accelerated text, with features tuned to balance performance and style. Download the latest version and take it
 for a spin. Bend is work in progress, expect bugs and occasional surprise features.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>Lightning fast.</h4>
<h3><img src="https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=bend&DownloadId=1473106" alt="" width="600"></h3>
Using a technique called virtualized display, Bend holds in memory just the lines you see on screen. When opening large files processing the lines not on screen is offloaded to a seperate thread. Infact Bend is faster than notepad at opening large files.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>Tabs.</h4>
Like every good editor Bend has tabs but it doesnt stop there, Bend supports tear away tabs along with drag &amp; drop tab rearrangement. Speaking of drag &amp; drop, hold down ALT while starting a tab drag to drop the file to another application like Windows
 Explorer or Visual Studio. <br>
<br>
<h4>Settings.</h4>
<h3><img src="https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=bend&DownloadId=1473104" alt="" width="600"></h3>
Knobs and buttons you can tweak to your taste. Choose a Theme, color Bend dark or Turn off line numbering. Everything you need is neatly hidden away behind the Bend logo.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>Search.</h4>
<h3><img src="https://www.codeplex.com/Download?ProjectName=bend&DownloadId=1473107" alt="" width="600"></h3>
Find on page is easy to reach on the top right. Ctrl &#43; H brings up the Find &amp; Replace dialog where you can do advanced Regex Search and Replacement. If you already know where to go - Ctrl &#43; G brings up the goto line number dialog. Find on page is fluid,
 asynchronous and never makes you wait for Bend to catch up.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>Misc.</h4>
Lots of careful touches that you will appreciate. Find dims the entire page to make the search results stand out. Instant Zoom (ctrl&#43;mouse wheel). Right click integration with Windows Explorer. File change monitoring, notifies if the file you are editing changes
 underneath you. Syntax highlighting for over 30&#43; languages, plus heuristics that detect the language as you type. Infinite Clipboard (Ctrl &#43; Shift &#43; Insert), never loose anything you copied within Bend.&nbsp;<br>
<h4>Auto Update.</h4>
Bend is built on Microsoft ClickOnce technology and auto updates every 7 days, this makes sure you always have the latest and greatest.</div>
